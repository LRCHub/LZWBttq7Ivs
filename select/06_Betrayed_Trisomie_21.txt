Any strange woman, you're fond of love
I can prevent your head to rotate
Don't you feel the heat (that it?) must we forget that life go on
But I can't give birth to someone else
A flock we make sure life is (here?)
You are afraid by words, you keep them from the light
(Your heart) fly away and fly over us
It's hide and seek, must we forget that life go on
It's hide and seek, must we forget that life go on
You spend reality watching
Your (arms) moving in charity
Only banned for love when you die
To defend the man in his tears
You know (?) to the sun
(As we begun mature in both arms?)
The object of motion
You strange woman, you're fond of love
I can prevent your head to rotate
Don't you feel the heat, must we forget that life go on
But I can't give birth to someone else
The object of motion
The object of motion"
