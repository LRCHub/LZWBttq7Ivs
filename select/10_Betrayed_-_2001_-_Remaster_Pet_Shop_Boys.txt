Did you ever feel betrayed by someone in your life?
Did you ever give your trust and have it sold?
For the sake of cheap expedience I now experience
Feeling betrayed by you

I woke at five this morning with you on my mind
Replaying conversations in my head
You said if you'd to choose between some money and a friend
You'd always choose the friend

So how come you could change your mind so easily?
How was it so speedily arranged?
You struck an easy bargain when persuaded it was not
And now it's all you've got

And still you need to justify yourself
To others but not me
With that more-in-sorrow-than-anger routine
Sometimes I think I'm going mad
When I hear you've said 'It's sad
He feels hard done by me'

Did you ever give a thought for someone else's pride?
Your actions prove that actually you did
And threw it out the door as opportunity came through
I'd been betrayed by you

And still you need to justify yourself
To others but not me
With that more-in-sorrow-than-anger routine
Sometimes I think I'm going mad
When I hear you've said 'it's sad
He feels hard done by me'

Did you ever feel betrayed by someone in your life?
Did you ever give your trust and have it sold?
For the sake of cheap expedience I now experience
Being betrayed by you
That's all you had to do
To make me feel betrayed by you
